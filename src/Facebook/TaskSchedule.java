 * We have a list of tasks, they will be run in sequence. For each same tasks, there is a cool down time in the CPU
 * 
 * Given a task sequence and interval between 2 same tasks, return the running time of the tasks
 * 
 * For Example , the interval for task B is 3,  the running time of task list BB will be 5 ( 1+ 3(cool down) + 1)
 * 
 * Follow up: Given a task list and interval, return the sequence that requires minimum time.
